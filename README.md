## üìÅ Scripts / Notebooks Folder Structure and Usage

The `scripts` and `notebooks` folders in this repository are organized into subfolders corresponding to sections from the `course.md` page. Each subfolder contains links to Python scripts or notebooks named after the links provided in the respective section. These examples serve as references or starting points for exploring the topics mentioned in the links. Here's how to navigate and use the scripts:

- **Vector Search in Databricks**: Contains scripts or notebooks related to understanding and creating vector search indexes in Databricks.
- **RAG-Pattern in Databricks**: Includes scripts or notebooks that explain the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern in Databricks.
- **Model Tuning in Databricks**: Features scripts or notebooks for understanding Hugging Face Transformers, fine-tuning models, and foundation model training in Databricks.

To use these scripts and notebooks, navigate to the corresponding subfolder and select the script that matches your interest. Each script includes a comment linking back to the original documentation page for further reading and context. The example notebooks are organized similarly.
