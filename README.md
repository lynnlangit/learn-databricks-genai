## üìÅ Scripts Folder Structure and Usage

The `scripts` folder in this repository is organized into subfolders corresponding to sections from the `additional-material.md` page. Each subfolder contains Python scripts named after the links provided in the respective section. These scripts serve as references or starting points for exploring the topics mentioned in the links. Here's how to navigate and use the scripts:

- **Vector Search in Databricks**: Contains scripts related to understanding and creating vector search indexes in Databricks.
- **RAG-Pattern in Databricks**: Includes scripts that explain the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern in Databricks.
- **Model Tuning in Databricks**: Features scripts for understanding Hugging Face Transformers, fine-tuning models, and foundation model training in Databricks.

To use these scripts, navigate to the corresponding subfolder and select the script that matches your interest. Each script includes a comment linking back to the original documentation page for further reading and context.
The example notebooks are organized similarly.
